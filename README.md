## Tiny PGA
![CMake Test Status](https://github.com/sergehog/tiny_pga/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

Tiny, header-only, Differentiable and Template-optimized C++ library for 3D Projective Geometric Algebra (3D PGA)

(at least attempt to make it :-)

This is my own study-and-research  project, where I'm trying to develop practical tools and algorithms using PGA.
